AL_fit_PSO_bouts_prp_learn2.R contains code for fitting the extended AL model with PSO.

AL_new_helper_bout_test2.R contains helper functions for the extended AL model.

pso_helper_bouts_prp_learn contains functions for PSO.

# Helper functions

data_summary_fitting.R contains functions for computing the summary statistics for model fitting.


# Notes

May have to rearrange the directories (i.e., put all the files in the same folder).
Users will need to request the data. I cannot upload all the data to github.
